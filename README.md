Minecraft plugin 2: Apocalypse 1

This is a Minecraft Plugin using the Bukkit and Spigot library for multiplayer Minecraft servers. This plugin is meant to make Minecraft feel more like an apocalyptic survival
game with more intense gameplay than Vanilla Minecraft. It is meant for Minecraft Java Edition, 1.16.1.

A JAR file plugin is created that does the following in a Minecraft server:

- Gives each player a Crossbow Gun, which was created by me in Minecraft Plugin 1.
- Spawns many hostile mobs that are invisible and overpowered
- Makes the environment permanight, with lightnings strikes everywhere
- Makes some mobs drop good loot as a compensation to the intense difficulty.
- *potentially more features*
